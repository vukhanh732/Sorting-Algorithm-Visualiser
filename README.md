# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a simple, interactive web application for visualizing sorting algorithms. Currently, it supports four different sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort

Each algorithm is visualized as an animated bar chart, where each bar represents an element in an array, and the height of the bar represents the value of the element. 

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** This visualizer allows you to generate a new array and sort it using one of the available sorting algorithms. The sorting process is animated, so you can see how the algorithm rearranges the elements step by step to sort the array.

- **Algorithm Information:** For each sorting algorithm, the visualizer provides a brief description and details about its time and space complexity.

- **Speed Control:** You can control the speed of the animation to better understand the working of the algorithms.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- To generate a new array, click on the "Generate New Array" button.
- To sort the array, select one of the sorting algorithms by clicking the corresponding button.
- Use the speed slider to adjust the speed of the animation.

## Future Enhancements

The project is open for pull requests. Future enhancements can include addition of new sorting algorithms, improving user interface, and adding more interactive features like array size adjustment.
